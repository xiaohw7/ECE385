2. REPORT DETAILS

TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock HDMI_block0/hdmi_block_i/hdmi_text_controller_0/inst/clk_wiz/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_out1_hdmi_block_clk_wiz_1_0_1 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_hdmi_block_clk_wiz_1_0_1 and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_hdmi_block_clk_wiz_1_0_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_hdmi_block_clk_wiz_1_0_1 and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_hdmi_block_clk_wiz_1_0_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock HDMI_block0/hdmi_block_i/hdmi_text_controller_0/inst/clk_wiz/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin HDMI_block0/hdmi_block_i/hdmi_text_controller_0/inst/clk_wiz/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins

ULMTCS-2#1 Warning
Control Sets use limits require reduction  
This design uses 2489 control sets (vs. available limit of 8150, determined by 1 control set per CLB). This exceeds the control set use guideline of 15 percent. This is at a level where reduction is REQUIRED (see UG949). Use report_control_sets to get more details.
